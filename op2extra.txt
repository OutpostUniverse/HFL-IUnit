This is a compatability lib for projects that use IUnit, for use with HFL.

This will not function without HFL!

At the time of this writing, all functions except for Build(LOCATION) have been implemented.

The reason this is not done is because the Build packet requires extra info, 
which a LOCATION alone will not provide! we need the top-left tile as well as the location+the vech's location

I have included DoDeploy, which provides the same function however needs the extra arguments:

void DoDeploy(int tileX, int tileY, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) { ...
              lower-right tile XY   top-left XY     bottom-right XY
              of building           of dozed area   of dozed area


Source included... (most functions are direct calls to HFL UnitEx functions)

OP2Extra


What is it?
==========

This project adds extra functionality to the unit structure, which i've renamed OP2Unit.
It includes many more functions then the Unit class exported by Outpost2.

DISCLAIMER

Be advised, this library comes with NO warrenty whatsoever, and use it at your own risk.
I will try to update and bugfix it whenever i find something new.




How to use:
==========

Redefine ALL your occurences of the Unit class to use IUnit instead 
(this can easily be done using the search-and-replace action (CTRL+H) in MSVC++)
Include "IUnit.h" (and if nessecary "commands.h") into your source files,
and include "op2extra.lib" into your project (workspace).
Make sure op2extra.dll is in your Outpost2 folder!

Now you can use all other functions i've added as if they are just part of the unit classes.

For example:
IUnit u;
TethysGame::CreateUnit(u,mapRoboMiner,LOCATION(48,11),0,mapNone,0)
u.Build(LOCATION(62,14));

That will make the miner build its mine in the correct position, instead of from the 
"convec-pos" that it does, when using the RecordBuilding functions

Please check IUnit.h to see what functions were added.
